- [ ] At 01:30 PM, 300 km away from Town A

## Question 4 (***)

John and Emily are traveling towards each other from two different towns. John starts from Town A and travels towards Town B at a constant speed of 50 kilometers per hour. Emily starts from Town B and travels towards Town A at a constant speed of 40 kilometers per hour. The distance between the two towns is 600 kilometers.

However, John's speed is not constant throughout the journey. For the first 200 kilometers, John travels at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour. But for the next 200 kilometers, he increases his speed to 80 kilometers per hour. Finally, for the last 200 kilometers, he decreases his speed to 40 kilometers per hour. Emily maintains her constant speed of 40 kilometers per hour throughout her journey.

If both John and Emily start their journeys at the same time, how long will it take for them to meet each other?

### Answer

- [x] 6 hours
- [ ] 4 hours
- [ ] 5 hours
- [ ] 8 hours

### Explanation

This is a challenging problem. To solve this, we would need to focus on each 200 km length of the journey separately.

Time taken by John for the first 200 km = 200/50 = 4 hours
Time taken by John for the second 200 km = 200/80 = 2.5 hours
Time taken by John for the last 200 km = 200/40 = 5 hours

Now, Emily is traveling at a constant speed of 40 km/h. In the first 4 hours, she would travel 40 * 4 = 160 km.

In the first 4 hours, the total distance that they have covered is 200 km + 160 km = 360 km.

Distance left is 600 km - 360 km = 240 km. Now, given the fact that John's speed has increased for the next 200 km, they would meet during this phase of the journey.

For the 2nd phase of the journey, relative speed is the sum of their individual speed as they are traveling towards each other = 80 + 40 = 120 km/h.

Total distance to be covered = 240 km.

Therefore, total time taken = 240/120 = 2 hours.

So, they will meet each other after 4 + 2 = 6 hours.

In those 6 hours, John will travel = 50 km/h  * 4 h + 80 km/h * 2 h = 360 km.
In those 6 hours, Emily will travel = 40 km/h * 6 h = 240 km.
