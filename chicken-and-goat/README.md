# Chicken and Goat Problems

## Question 1

A farmer has some chickens and some goats. Together there are 116 heads and 282 legs. How many chickens and goats does the farmer have?

### Answer

25 goats and 91 chickens

### Explanation

Suppose there are only chickens. With 116 heads, there would be 116*2=232 legs. The 282-232=50 additional legs would have come from 50/2=25 goats. It implies that there are 116-25=91 chickens.
