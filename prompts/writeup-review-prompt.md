Title: AN UNEXPECTED GUEST

On a quiet Tuesday afternoon, Eliza was sitting on her Favourite armchair,
engrossed in a novel. Little did she know, her peaceful day was about to take a turn.

The doorbell rang, startling Eliza. She put down her book and approached the door
with a mix of excitement and caution. As she opened the door, she was met with an
unusual sight. Standing on her doorstep was a penguin. Yes, a penguin.it waddled
forward and looked up at her with its shining eyes. Eliza blinked, stunned.

'Hello there,' she said, shocked and amused. 'Are you lost?'

To her astonishment, the penguin nodded as if it understood her question. Eliza
decided to invite her unexpected guest inside. She quickly made a little nest for the
penguin with some towels and a bowl of water. As the penguin settled in, Eliza
could not help but wonder how it had ended up on her doorstep.

Weeks past and Eliza and the penguin, whom she named Percy, formed a bond.
They spent their days exploring the garden, reading together, and even attempting
some makeshift ice skating.

One evening, as Eliza and Percy were watching the sunset, a knock on the door
interrupted their moment. Eliza opened the door to find a man in a uniform from the
local zoo. He explained that Percy had escaped during a transfer and had been
missing for weeks. Although Eliza knew it was time for Percy to return to his rightful
home, the thought of saying goodbye broke her heart. With tears in her eyes, Eliza
gently placed Percy in the man's arms.

As Percy was carried away, he turned his head and gave Eliza one last squawk, as if
to say goodbye.

From that day forward, Eliza continued to read by the window, a small penguin pillow
sitting beside her, a reminder of the unexpected visitor who had brought an
extraordinary adventure into her life.
