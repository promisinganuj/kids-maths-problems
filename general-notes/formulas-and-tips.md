## Edges and Vertices of common 3D shapes

Shape | Edges | Vertices
--- | --- | --- |
Cube | 12 | 8
Rectangular Prism | 12 | 8
Cylinder | 3 (2 bases and 1 side) | 2 (top and bottom)
Cone | 1 (base) | 1 (apex)
Sphere | N/A | N/A
Pyramid | 8 | 5

### Note:
- For the Sphere, since it is a curved surface with no edges or vertices, the values are marked as N/A (not applicable).
- For the Cylinder, it has 3 edges (2 bases and 1 side) and 2 vertices (top and bottom).
- For the Cone, it has 1 edge (the base) and 1 vertex (the apex).
- For the Pyramid, the number of edges and vertices can vary depending on the type and base shape of the pyramid. It may have a different number of edges and vertices based on its base (triangular, square, pentagonal, etc.).

## Trigonometric Formulas

### Right Triangle

Description | Formula
--- | --- |
Pythagorean Theorem | $a^2+b^2=c^2$
Sine | $\sin(\theta)=\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}=\frac{a}{c}$
Cosine | $\cos(\theta)=\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}=\frac{b}{c}$
Tangent | $\tan(\theta)=\frac{opposite}{adjacent}=\frac{a}{b}$
Cosecant | $\csc(\theta)=\frac{hypotenuse}{opposite}=\frac{c}{a}$
Secant | $\sec(\theta)=\frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent}=\frac{c}{b}$
Cotangent | $\cot(\theta)=\frac{adjacent}{opposite}=\frac{b}{a}$

where $a$ is the opposite side, $b$ is the adjacent side and $c$ is the hypotenuse
