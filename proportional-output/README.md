# Proportional Output Problems

## Question 1

Suppose it takes 4 workers working 6 hours per day to produce 360 units of a product. How many workers would be needed to produce 600 units of the same product if each worker worked for 8 hours per day?

### Answer

- [x] 5
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 8
- [ ] 4

### Explanation

For such sums, it is easier to start by writing the details in tabular format. The variable which needs to be calculated should be written at the last:

```text
Units | Hours | Workers
-----------------------
360   | 6     | 4
600   | 8     | ?
```

#### Method 1

The easiest way to solve such problems is by using logical reasoning about the impact of changing each input variable on the output variable, while keeping rest of the input variables unchanged. Here is how it works:

Keeping the hours unchanged, if 360 units are made by 4 workers, it would take more workers to make 600 units so we multiply by a fraction which is >1 i.e., (600/360).

Now, keeping the units unchanged, if each worker is working 6 hours, it takes 4 workers to finish the job. So, if each worker works for 8 hours, it would take less workers to finish the same amount of work. Thus in this case, we multiply by a fraction which is <1 i.e., (6/8).

Combining everything, No. of required Workers = 4 * (600/360) * (6/8) = 5.

#### Method 2

To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion:

(Number of workers) x (Number of hours worked per day) x (Output per worker per hour) = Total output

Using the values given in the problem, we get:

(4) x (6) x (Output per worker per hour) = 360

Simplifying, we get:

Output per worker per hour = 15

Now we can use this value to solve for the number of workers needed to produce 600 units with 8 hours per day:

(Number of workers) x (8) x (15) = 600

Simplifying, we get:

(Number of workers) = 5

Therefore, 5 workers would be needed to produce 600 units of the product in 8 hours per day.

## Question 2

Suppose a factory produces a certain product, and it takes 4 workers working 8 hours per day to produce 160 units of the product. If the factory wants to produce 1200 units of the same product, how many workers will be needed if they work 12 hours per day? Assume that the output per worker per hour is constant.

### Answer

- [ ] 10
- [ ] 12
- [ ] 15
- [x] 20

### Explanation

```text
Units | Hours | Workers
-----------------------
160   | 8     | 4
1200  | 12    | ?
```

No. of required Workers = 4 * (1200/160) * (8/12) = 20.
