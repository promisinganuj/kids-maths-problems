# Elimination Problems

## Question 1

Each school sent 3 runners in a team cross country race. Alice, Belinda and Clara were the three representatives for their school. Alice finished the race in middle position, Belinda finished after Alice, in 19th position, and Clara finished 28th. How many runners took part in the race?

### Answer

- [ ] 27
- [ ] 30
- [x] 33
- [ ] 36

### Explanation

Alice finished in middle position implies that there were odd number of participants and that eliminates 30 and 36. Given that Clara finished 28th, there must be more than 28 participants and thus 33 is the answer.

## Question 2

A farmer has some chickens and some goats. Together there are 116 heads and 282 legs. How many chickens and goats does the farmer have?

### Answer

- [ ] 18 goats and 125 chickens
- [ ] 25 goats and 100 chickens
- [ ] 20 goats and 110 chickens
- [x] 25 goats and 91 chickens

### Explanation

This problem is also part of [chicken-and-goat](../chicken-and-goat/README.md) problem. But this can be easily solved by elimination. The number of heads is 116. So, the sum of chickens and goats in the answers must be 116. And only the last option satisfies this condition.
