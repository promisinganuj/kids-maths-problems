# Elimination Problems

## Question 1

Each school sent 3 runners in a team cross country race. Alice, Belinda and Clara were the three representatives for their school. Alice finished the race in middle position, Belinda finished after Alice, in 19th position, and Clara finished 28th. How many runners took part in the race?

### Answer

- [ ] 27
- [ ] 30
- [x] 33
- [ ] 36

### Explanation

Alice finished in middle position implies that there were odd number of participants and that eliminates 30 and 36. Given that Clara finished 28th, there must be more than 28 participants and thus 33 is the answer.
