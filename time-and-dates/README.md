# Time, Date and Day Problems

## Question 1

Which day of the week will Sam's birthday fall on in 2023, if he was born on March 15th, and January 2nd of 2023 falls on a Monday?

### Answer

- [x] Wednesday
- [ ] Friday
- [ ] Monday
- [ ] Tuesday

### Explanation

To determine the day of the week on which Sam's birthday will fall in 2023, we can follow these steps:

Find the number of days between January 2nd and March 15th in 2023. To do this, we can count the number of days from January 2nd to January 31st (29 days), from February 1st to February 28th (28 days), and from March 1st to March 15th (15 days): 
29 + 28 + 15 = 72 days

Note here that we don't count the starting day. That's why the number of days in January is not 30 (30-2+1) but 29 (31-2).

Divide the number of days by 7 to get the number of full weeks between January 2nd and March 15th.
72 รท 7 = 10 weeks remainder 2 days

This means that there are 10 full weeks and 2 extra days between January 2nd and March 15th.

Add the extra days to Monday (the day of the week on January 2nd) to find the day of the week on March 15th.
Since 2 extra days have passed, the day of the week on March 15th will be two days after Monday, which is Wednesday.
Therefore, Sam's birthday will fall on a Wednesday in 2023.
