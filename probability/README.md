# Probability

## Question 1

A bag contains 12 blue marbles and 8 red marbles. If one marble is chosen at random, what is the probability that it will be a blue marble?"

### Answer

- [ ] 0.5
- [ ] 0.8
- [x] 0.6
- [ ] 0.2

### Explanation

The total number of marbles in the bag is 12 + 8 = 20. The probability of choosing a blue marble is the number of blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles, which is:

12/20 = 3/5

So the probability of choosing a blue marble is 3/5 or 0.6.

Therefore, the probability that a marble chosen at random from the bag will be a blue marble is 0.6 or 60%.

## Question 2

In a certain country, car number plates consist of three letters followed by three digits (e.g., ABC123). If a car number plate is chosen at random, what is the probability that the plate contains at least one letter 'A'?

Hint: You can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem.

### Answer

- [x] 34.25
- [ ] 50.24
- [ ] 16.58
- [ ] 90.23

### Explanation

Let's first find the probability that the plate does not contain the letter 'A'. Since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, there are 25 letters other than 'A'. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen letter is not 'A' is 25/26. Since there are three letters in the plate, the probability that none of them are 'A' is:

(25/26) x (25/26) x (25/26) = 0.6575 (approx.)

So the probability that the plate contains at least one 'A' is the complement of this, i.e., 1 minus the probability that none of the letters are 'A'. Therefore:

P(at least one 'A') = 1 - 0.6575 = 0.3425 (approx.)

So the probability that a car number plate chosen at random contains at least one letter 'A' is approximately 0.3425 or 34.25%.
